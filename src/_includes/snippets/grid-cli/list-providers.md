You can generate a list of all the available providers in the Grid Intensity CLI by running the `grid-intensity provider list` command. This will generate a table output with the provider name, and related website URL.

```bash
grid-intensity provider list

NAME                  URL
CarbonIntensityOrgUK  carbonintensity.org.uk
ElectricityMaps       electricitymaps.com
Ember                 ember-climate.org
WattTime              watttime.org
```
